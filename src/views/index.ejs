                    Lorem Ipsum is 192.0.2.126 simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
                    ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 192.0.2.126 took a galley of type and scrambled 292.0.2.126 it to make a type specimen book. It
                    has survived not only five centuries, but 1.2.3.4 also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 31.142.173.104 essentially unchanged.
                    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                    software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                <p>
                    Front End and Back End used<br>
                    For front end and Back end we have used a JS as a language<br>
                    And for database we have used a database known as SQLite<br>
                    Modules used are express, sqlite3, sqlite, ejs<br>
                    Here express is used for serving web server app, and used as a middle man between client and database.<br>
                    sqlite 3 is database driver for connecting database and application<br>
                    It is also used for querying the database from application.<br>
                    Sqlite is used as a wrapper for the database driver (sqlite3), as sqlite3 is hard to use directly, we have used a module to make the program more simple and understandable.
