                <p>
                    Front End and Back End used<br>
                    For front end and Back end we have used a JS as a language<br>
                    And for database we have used a database known as SQLite<br>
                    Modules used are express, sqlite3, sqlite, ejs<br>
                    Here express is used for serving web server app, and used as a middle man between client and database.<br>
                    sqlite 3 is database driver for connecting database and application<br>
                    It is also used for querying the database from application.<br>
                    Sqlite is used as a wrapper for the database driver (sqlite3), as sqlite3 is hard to use directly, we have used a module to make the program more simple and understandable.

                <p>
                    Step 1 > Downloade the project from <a href="https://github.com/MiniProjectGrp/CrimeRecord" class="srcLink" >here</a>. <br>
                    Step 2 > Run the command <strong>npm ci</strong> to install all the required packages. <br>
                    Step 3 > To run the server the command is <strong>node app.js</strong>
